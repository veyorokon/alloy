# Walkthrough on building on Windows 10 using ubuntu Subsystem
# June 6th 2017

1. Make sure you have linux subsystem enabled on windows 10

2. Clone or download this repo

3. Install the following dependencies:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev 

sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8++-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost1.37-dev # Feel free to use libboost1.55-dev or whatever



4. Compile the code

First set proper permission for leveldb

cd src
chmod 755 leveldb/build_detect_platform

Now run makefile to do actual compilation from the alloy/src folder

make -f makefile.unix

5. Run what you just compiled from within alloy/src

./alloycoind

and you should get the following output:

'It is recommended you use the following random password:
rpcuser=alloycoinrpc
rpcpassword=AxXa1EEubaRncHtn5bsNLzw935bWnZETkv2uNwSLdpk3
(you do not need to remember this password)
The username and password MUST NOT be the same.
If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.
It is also recommended to set alertnotify so you are notified of problems;
for example: alertnotify=echo %s | mail -s "Alloycoin Alert" admin@foo.com'

6. Create a config that is personalized to you:

emacs alloycoin.conf # Or use whatever editor you would like (i.e. vim, gedit, nano, etc)

The contents of the file should be the following:

server=1
listen=1
proxy=207.154.228.12
dbcache=50
daemon=1
testnet=0
maxuploadtarget=200
rpcuser=alloycoinrpc
rpcpassword=9yZBDHVQP7NCwCh9NMt9UQXfex9j8TKBQLfTQMx2642R
alertnotify=echo %s | mail -s "Alloycoin Alert" your_email_here

Save the file in home/your_username/.alloycoin/ and exit the editor

7. run .alloycoind again and you should get a message saying 'Alloycoin server starting'

8. Next, check you can access the server
